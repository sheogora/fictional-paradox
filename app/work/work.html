      <h4>SAP - Software Developer</h4>
      <p>I was part of the User Experience & Design Team of which the most recent project was BUILD, which is an application that provides a comprehensive set of tools that allows a user to learn, design, get user feedback and publish an application using either low fidelity prototypes or fully designed web application using UI5. The application is coded using AngularJS, Node.js and running on Jenkins, GitHub, with a MongoDB backend.</p>
      <p>Initially when I started I had the opportunity to work on the xRay project. xRay is a plugin to Fiory applications that improves the experience of the user by providing an overlay over the application that contain hotspots as points of interest as well as comprehensive guided walkthroughs of the application for the user. Developed using SAPUI5 running on Jenkins and Gerrit.</p>
      <p>Some of my jobs included writting comprehensive code, e2e automation, unit tests, intergration tests, customer assistance and task planning.</p>

      <h4>"Motion Synthesis Using Relative Joint Distances" - MSc Project</h4>
      <p>In the field of animation, where reuse of motion capture files is highly advised due to its expensive operation and time consuming setup, methods such as motion graphs give the ability to synthesis high quality motions using only a limited set of basic motion capture files. Effective motion graph construction has been in research since 2002, where the most highly used motion similarity method is computing Euclidean distances between joints. However, finding new methods for motion similarity that can emulate human perception could provide better overall motion graph results.</p>
      <p>My dissertation project proposes the use of Joint Relative Distance method in motion graph construction. The method uses relative joint distance values for pose comparison between two motions. Transition points are selected from areas of frames with high similarity and pruned based on three criteria to determine optimal transition points to be used in the motion graph. This method is examined in comparison to previous motion graph construction methods and the results are evaluated with three demo applications that focus on stationary dance motions as well as bipedal.</p>
      <p>Coded in C++ and OpenGL.</p>

      <h4>MasterCard - Software Developer Intern</h4>
      <p>I was part of a 7 person project on MasterCards inControl team, developing an internal software application for the purpose of simplifying the process of customer registration to the database.</p>
      <p>My main tasks involved planning, developing high quality code, automation and maintenance of the whole code base from scratch.</p>
      <p>Some of the technologies I had the opportunity to work with where Google Web Toolkit, Java, SQL and XML database calls.</p>

      <h4>"BDI agent with Machine Learning for 2kbotprize" - AI Project</h4>
      <p>I worked on a project that looked into intelligent thinking during decision making of an agent in a First Person Shooter game called Unreal Tournament. The AI was developed using a Pogamut module called Gamebots 2004 in Java using SQLite as a memory component. The goal of the AI is to trick a human into thinking it is another human player.</p>
      <p>The main focus of implementation was the Belief Desire Intention architecture that was modeled after interview surveys conducted on volunteer participants. Later, machine learning was added to provide a portion of human unpredictability based on the Multi-Armed Bandit problem.</p>

      <h4>Graphics, Vision, Visualisation Group, Trinity College Dublin - Research Assistant</h4>
      <p>I originally started working on incorporating occlusion culling in the already existing Metropolis project, a virtual recontruction of Dublin city center and Trinity College Dublin.</p>
      <p>The primary technologies of the project are C++ and Ogre3D.</p>
      <p>Later on as my college year started I worked part time on Motion Capture correction, using Vicon Blade technology. When a motion is recorded using a velcro suit and markers that are positioned on joints, some of the motions when recorded into digital format have issues which need to be manually corrected.</p>

      <h4>Symantec - Software Developer Intern</h4>
      <p>Following a successful college project for Symantec, I was offered an internship with the SES Department to work on an internal website which allowed employees to rent hardware and software.</p>
      <p>The project was written in Django and Python.</p>
      <p>Later on I worked on a legacy project which required several adjustments so I got the opportunity to learn a new techology which I never worked in before. The software was written in ASP.NET, Visual Basic and C#.</p>
