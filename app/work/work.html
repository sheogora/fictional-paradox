			<h4>SAP</h4>
			<p>When I started I had the opportunity to work on the xRay project as a developer with the User Experience & Design Team. xRay is a plugin to Fiory applications that improves the experience of the user by providing an overlay over the application that contain hotspots as points of interest as well as comprehensive guided walkthroughs of the application for the user. Developed using SAPUI5 development toolkit. </p>
			<p>I am currently working on SAP BUILD, which is an application that provides a comprehensive set of tools that allows a user to learn, design, get user feedback and publish an application using either low fidelity prototypes or fully designed web application using UI5. The application is coded using Angular and MongoDB. </p>
			<p>Some of my jobs included writting comrehensive code, e2e automation, unit tests, intergration tests, customer assistance and task planning.</p>

			<h4>MSc Project - "Motion Synthesis Using Relative Joint Distances"</h4>
			<p>In the field of animation, where reuse of motion capture files is highly advised due to its expensive operation and time consuming setup, methods such as motion graphs give the ability to synthesis high quality motions using only a limited set of basic motion capture files. Effective motion graph construction has been in research since 2002, where the most highly used motion similarity method is computing Euclidean distances between joints. However, finding new methods for motion similarity that can emulate human perception could provide better overall motion graph results.</p>
			<p>The following dissertation proposes the use of Joint Relative Distance (JRD) method in motion graph construction. The method uses relative joint distance values for pose comparison between two motions. Transition points are selected from areas of frames with high similarity and pruned based on three criteria to determine optimal transition points to be used in the motion graph. This method is examined in comparison to previous motion graph construction methods and the results are evaluated with three demo applications that focus on stationary dance motions as well as bipedal.</p>
