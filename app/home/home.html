          <p class="about-para">My name is Angela Kravcevich and I am a Dublin based Software Engineer. I have a BA (Mod) Degree and a Masters Degree in Computer Science from Trinity College Dublin. Studying in Trinity provided me with the necessary skills to adapt and enjoy working with any technology and language. In my free time I enjoy artistic pastimes such as painting in photoshop or body painting with the Dublin Body Painters group.</p>

          <p class="about-para">I decided to construct this webpage as a gallery of my art work as well as a self learning project of setting up and running a nodeJS website. The full code for this page is available on <a href="https://github.com/sheogora/fictional-paradox" target="_blank">Github</a>.</p>

          <h2>My Art</h2>
          <div class="about-para">
            <p>I enjoyed drawing and painting as long as I remember. I am a self taught artist who explored many different mediums such as pencils, acrylic paints, sculpting, watercolor, face/body painting, and now recently I have settled into digital media. I have a simple Wacom Bamboo Tablet that use to draw using Photoshop CS6. </p>

            <p> I am constantly learning and trying to improve and you can find some of my artwork on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sheogora/"  target="_blank">Instagram</a>, <a href="https://www.artstation.com/sheogora"  target="_blank">Artstation</a> or <a href="#!/art">here</a>. I also stream myself painting in my free time on <a href="https://go.twitch.tv/plunderbun"  target="_blank">Twitch</a></p>

          <h2>Body Painting</h2>
          <div class="about-para">
            <p>Body Painting is one of the most interesting hobbies I found myself enjoying and is quite different to normal art I am used to. With Body Paint, you have to work with a given amount of time as well as the comfort of your model and once you are done there is usually only several hours for photographs before the artwork has to be washed away. Pair all of that with the intricate shape of the human body and it makes whatever you are painting that more special and becomes more about the experience of creating rather than having something on display after. </p>

            <p>I find myself comparing it to looking at a picture of a sculpture. It is not the same unless you are there to look at it, but you can still look at my work <a href="#!/bodypaint">here</a></p>
